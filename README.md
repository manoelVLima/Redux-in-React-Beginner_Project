## Project developed by [Manoel Vieira Lima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoel-vieira-lima-junior-589838127/).

This is my first project using Redux and Hook in React. It introduced me how to control states with Redux to be able to use them in every component of my application in a simple way.

## About the project

The project is a simple application that uses a fakeAPI from [FakeAPI Store](https://fakestoreapi.com/), to simulate the main page of an online store. The most important thing is how the application works. It uses Redux to store states that can be used in all application components without having to pass them through props or callbacks.

## Skills

Some skills that were used:
- React;
- React Router(to browse products);
- Redux(control states);
- Hooks(manipulate states);
- Semantic UI for the CSS
